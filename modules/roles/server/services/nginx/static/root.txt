Hello World!

I'm Xi, a dedicated Computer Science student at Mohawk College.
This is my personal space on the web, kept simple and straightforward
because I believe in the power of clarity and efficiency.

Q: What are your plans for the next five years?

A: Over the next five years, my primary goal is to secure a role as a
Machine Learning Engineer in a leading tech company or research institution.
In my spare time, I plan to become the next Beethoven (or at least learn to play
"Chopsticks" on the piano). I also aim to publish at least five groundbreaking papers
in NLP that will make even the most seasoned researchers say, "Why didn't I think of that?"
I'm committed to continuous learning and growth in the field of AI, aiming to contribute
significantly to its advancement (and maybe even create an AI that can finally beat me at chess).

***

Q: And what about the next ten years?

A: Looking further ahead, in the next ten years, I aspire to become a Senior Research Scientist
or an AI Lead, where I can drive more significant projects and research initiatives. My ultimate goal
is to start my own AI startup, focusing on developing AI technologies that are ethical, sustainable,
and beneficial for society. I envision creating solutions that not only advance the field of AI
but also have a positive impact on humanity.

Q: What programming languages and technologies are you focusing on?

A: Currently, my focus is on mastering Python, given its extensive use in AI and Machine Learning.
I'm also exploring R for statistical analysis, TensorFlow and PyTorch for deep learning, and I'm
keen on keeping up with emerging technologies in AI and ML. I believe in using the right tool for the
right job, and I'm always ready to learn new languages or frameworks that can help me achieve my goals.

***

Q: How do you plan to achieve these ambitious goals?

A: My strategy involves a combination of rigorous academic study, practical project experience, and
active participation in the AI research community. I plan to engage in internships and collaborative
projects with peers and professionals in the field. Networking with industry experts and researchers
through conferences and seminars will also be a key part of my journey. I believe that a strong foundation
in both theory and application, along with a proactive approach to opportunities, is essential for success in the AI field.
