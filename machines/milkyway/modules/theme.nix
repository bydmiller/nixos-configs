# Global theme
#
# Note:
# - Although I have implemented some serialization for the theme names, but I would
# recommend to use the same name for the modules.themes.colorscheme.name as the folder name
# in the /themes folder
# - Changing the theme name is a big step, as it will build the theme from scratch for
# a lot of applications, so be patient
#
{
  modules.themes.colorscheme = {
    # name = "catppuccin-mocha";
    # name = "alph"; # just make sure theme name is same as the folder name in /themes folder
    # name = "ashes";
    name = "atelier-cave";
  };
}
