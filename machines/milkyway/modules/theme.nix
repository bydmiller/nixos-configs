# Global base16 themes
#
# My Ratings based on usability and aesthetics:
# - 10 - catppuccino-mocha, alph, gruvbox-light-hard, catppuccino-frappe, emil
# - 9.7 - gruvbox-dark-hard, ember
# - 8.5 - ashes, fairy-floss
# - 6 - atelier-cave
#
# Note:
# - Although I have implemented some serialization for the theme names, but I would
# recommend to use the same name for the modules.themes.colorscheme.name as the folder name
# in the /themes folder
# - Changing the theme name is a big step, as it will build the theme from scratch for
# a lot of applications, so be patient
