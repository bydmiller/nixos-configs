# Global theme
#
# Note:
# - Although I have implemented some serialization for the theme names, but I would
# recommend to use the same name for the modules.themes.colorscheme.name as the folder name
# in the /themes folder
# - Changing the theme name is a big step, as it will build the theme from scratch for
# a lot of applications, so be patient

  modules.themes.colorscheme = {
    # name = "catppuccin-mocha"; # Dark color theme (10/10)
    # name = "alph"; # White color theme (9/10)
    # name = "ashes"; # Dark color theme (8.5/10)
    # name = "atelier-cave"; # Dark color theme (6/10)
    name = "catppuccin-frappe"; # Dark color theme (8/10)
